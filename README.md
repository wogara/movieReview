# movieReview

This is a fullstack RESTful application where users can post and comment on their favorite movies. The backend is NodeJS with MongoDB as a database. I also used the Bootstrap4 library on the frontend.

NodeJS, Javascript, CSS, HTML, MongoDB, Express, Passport (NPM package for authentication)
